All For One React Rebuild

This is a rebuild of the All For One Assignment. It utilizes React instead of vanilla JS. The styling and functionality are the same, however.

2/8/24: Created the react files and added every component necessary for the website. All styling is done, just need the JS and the API fetches for the JS. Easier said than done, I imagine. 2/9/24 pt:1: Partially added the JS logic. It's complete on half of the components, it's just a copy/paste and adjust for the rest of the components. Getting the first component to work was not fun. 2/9/24 pt 2: Done with the JS, finished. The API is local, not on Azure, so I still need to do that and replace the fetch links. 2/9/24 pt 3: Hosted the Api to Azure, and replaced the local host links with the Azure links. Fully operational.

Peer Review Comments: Very nicely done, Sebastian! Your site has excellent responsiveness. Each of your endpoints has data validation where necessary and everything works as it is supposed to. Very clean.
