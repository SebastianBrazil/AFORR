All For One React Rebuild

Desc

2/8/24: Created the react files and added every component necessary for the website. All styling is done, just need the JS and the API fetches for the JS. Easier said than done, I imagine. 2/9/24 pt:1: Partially added the JS logic. It's complete on half of the components, it's just a copy/paste and adjust for the rest of the components. Getting the first component to work was not fun.

Peer Review:
